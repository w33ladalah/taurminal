# Taurminal: A Terminal Emulator Built with Tauri, React, and TypeScript

Taurminal is a desktop application designed to function as a terminal emulator. It leverages the power of **Tauri** for lightweight and secure desktop app development, **React** for building dynamic user interfaces, and **TypeScript** for type-safe and maintainable code. The project is built using **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds.

## Features

- **Terminal Emulator**: Provides a customizable and efficient terminal experience.
- **Tauri Integration**: Ensures a lightweight and secure desktop application.
- **React + TypeScript**: Enables a modern, scalable, and maintainable front-end architecture.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs seamlessly on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
